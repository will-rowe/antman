# A.N.T.M.A.N

Automated Nanopore Tracking, Modification + Analysis daemoN

> very much a WIP (incl. the backronym)

## What is it

At the moment, it doesn't do much...

It will run in the background and register any new FASTQ files that appear in a given directory (and sub directories).

FASTQ files are checked and added to a processing queue. You can start / stop antman and tell it where to watch.

Each FASTQ read is sketched (using KMV MinHash) and will be checked for containment in the target genome(s).

Next up, it will query/update a LIMS and kick of specific workflows.

## Install

* depends on libfswatch, at the moment I'm just getting this with brew

```bash
brew install fswatch
```

* then just run the makefile

```bash
make clean
make test
make
```

## Commands

```bash
antman -start
antman -stop
antman -setWatchDir /path/to/some/dir
```

## TODO

* at the moment, it just uses the log file for tracking active PID - it needs to actually check these PIDs in case the log file becomes corrupted
